Developing a React application that can scale and be easily maintained is essential for long-term success. A well-organized and efficient codebase allows developers to work more productively, collaborate seamlessly, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs.

While the concept of "best practices" can be subjective and vary depending on the project's context, these recommendations are born from my experience with what I have found to be effective for building scalable React Applications.

So, let's dive in and explore these opinionated strategies to elevate your React development journey!

## Segregate parts of each component

Separate the parts of the component code for improved clarity and navigation into the following (Optionally add the comments mentioned below to find sections easily with search) -

- Hooks (every hook except useState and useReducer)
- States (useState and useReducer)
- Functions
- Constants
- JSX (return statements)

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Component = () => {
  // hooks
  const myContext = useContext();
  const isNew = useCustomHook();
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);

  // states
  const [showDetails, setShowDetails] = useState(false);
  const [data, setData] = useState<string[]>(["hello"]);

  // functions
  useEffect(() => {}, []);

  const myFunc = () => {};

  // constants
  const subTitle = user.name + "welcome";

  return (
    <div>
      Hello component <span>{subTitle}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Write more PURE functions

- Writing code in multiple smaller functions helps make code more readable and intuitive.
  For example, consider the below component with a large function that performs multiple tasks simultaneously, making it challenging to understand its purpose without thoroughly reading the code.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const PriceCalculator = () => {
  const calculateTotalPrice = (cart, discountRate, taxRate) => {
    let totalPrice = 0;

    for (const item of cart) {
      const itemPrice = item.price * item.quantity;
      totalPrice += itemPrice;

      if (itemPrice > 100) {
        const additionalDiscount = itemPrice * 0.1;
        totalPrice += itemPrice - additionalDiscount;
      } else {
        totalPrice += itemPrice;
      }
    }

    if (cart.length > 10) {
      const discount = totalPrice * discountRate;
      const additionalDiscount = discount * 0.2;
      totalPrice -= additionalDiscount;
    } else {
      totalPrice -= totalPrice * discountRate;
    }

    for (const item of cart) {
      if (item.category === "electronics") {
        const additionalTax = item.price * taxRate * 0.1;
        totalPrice += additionalTax;
      } else {
        totalPrice += item.price * taxRate;
      }
    }

    return totalPrice;
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => calculateTotalPrice(20, 20, 20)}>
      Calculate tax
    </button>
  );
};
```
