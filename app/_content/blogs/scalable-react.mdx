Developing a React application that can scale and be easily maintained is essential for long-term success. A well-organized and efficient codebase allows developers to work more productively, collaborate seamlessly, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs.

While the concept of "best practices" can be subjective and vary depending on the project's context, these recommendations are born from my experience with what I have found to be effective for building scalable React Applications.

So, let's dive in and explore these opinionated strategies to elevate your React development journey!

## Prefer Compound components over Monolithic

- When you have a single component that takes in multiple props and takes multiple responsibilities for itself and its children, it’s better to just use/convert the component into a compound component.
- Compound components provide a more modular and organized way of composing a complex UI, making it easier to manage, maintain, and extend.

For example, take a monolithic `Layout` component —

```tsx showLineNumbers
const MonolithicLayout = ({ headerTitle, footerTitle, body, actions }) => {
  // Multiple responsibilities handled within this component
  return (
    <div className="layout-wrapper">
      <div className="header">{headerTitle}</div>
      <div className="body">{body}</div>
      <div className="footer">{footerTitle}</div>
      {actions}
    </div>
  );
};

const Comp = () => {
  return (
    <MonolithicLayout
      headerTitle="Company name"
      footerTitle="Contact me"
      body="This is body"
      actions={<Button />}
    />
  );
};
```

Now say you want to use this component somewhere else but do not need a "footer" there, also "actions" should be at the top, so now to make these changes, we'd do something like this -

```tsx showLineNumbers
const MonolithicLayout = ({
  headerTitle,
  footerTitle,
  body,
  actions,
  showFooter,
  actionPosition = 'bottom',
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="layout-wrapper">
      {actionPosition === 'top' && actions}
      <div className="header">{headerTitle}</div>
      <div className="body">{body}</div>
      {showFooter && <div className="footer">{footerTitle}</div>}
      {actionPosition === 'bottom' && actions}
    </div>
  );
};

const Comp = () => {
  return (
    <MonolithicLayout
      headerTitle="Company name"
      footerTitle={null}
      showFooter={false}
      body="This is body"
      actions={<Button />}
      actionPosition="top"
    />
  )
}
```


The changes required to achieve this quickly turned the monolithic component into a mess.
Now, let's refactor the monolithic Layout component into a compound component -

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Header = ({ title }) => {
  return <div className="header">{title}</div>;
};
const Footer = ({ title }) => {
  return <div className="footer">{title}</div>;
};
const Body = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="body">{children}</div>;
};
const Actions = ({ children }) => {
  return children;
};
const CompoundLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="layout-wrapper">{children}</div>;
};

const Layout = Object.assign(CompoundLayout, {
  Header,
  Footer,
  Body,
  Actions,
});

const Comp = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Layout.Header title="Company name" />
      <Layout.Body>This is body</Layout.Body>
      <Layout.Footer title="Contact me" />
      <Layout.Actions>
        <Button />
      </Layout.Actions>
    </Layout>
  );
};

```


The compound component pattern may seem to have more code compared to the monolithic one, but it offers significant benefits, especially when new requirements arise or when you need to customize specific parts of the layout differently.
Let's try to implement the same requirement (no "footer" and "actions" on top) again but with a compound Layout component -

```tsx showLineNumbers
...

const Layout = Object.assign(CompoundLayout, {
  Header,
  Footer,
  Body,
  Actions,
});

const Comp = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Layout.Actions>
        <Button />
      </Layout.Actions>
      <Layout.Header title="Company name" />
      <Layout.Body>This is body</Layout.Body>
    </Layout>
  );
};
```


* With this pattern, you can easily rearrange the order of components without modifying the Layout component itself.
* You also have a lot of control over individual components directly which makes it easier to apply styles or capture events from these elements.
* This flexibility and separation of responsibilities make the compound component approach a more scalable and maintainable solution in the long run.

## Segregate parts of each component

Separate the parts of the component code for improved clarity and navigation into the following (Optionally add the comments mentioned below to find sections easily with search) -

- Hooks (every hook except `useState` and `useReducer`)
- States (`useState` and `useReducer`)
- Functions
- Constants
- JSX (`return` statements)

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Component = () => {
  // hooks
  const myContext = useContext();
  const isNew = useCustomHook();
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);

  // states
  const [showDetails, setShowDetails] = useState(false);
  const [data, setData] = useState<string[]>(["hello"]);

  // functions
  useEffect(() => {}, []);

  const myFunc = () => {};

  // constants
  const subTitle = user.name + "welcome";

  return (
    <div>
      Hello component <span>{subTitle}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## Write more PURE functions

Writing code in multiple smaller functions helps make code more readable and intuitive.
For example, consider the below component with a large function that performs multiple tasks simultaneously, making it challenging to understand its purpose without thoroughly reading the code.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const PriceCalculator = () => {
  const calculateTotalPrice = (cart, discountRate, taxRate) => {
    let totalPrice = 0;

    for (const item of cart) {
      const itemPrice = item.price * item.quantity;
      totalPrice += itemPrice;

      if (itemPrice > 100) {
        const additionalDiscount = itemPrice * 0.1;
        totalPrice += itemPrice - additionalDiscount;
      } else {
        totalPrice += itemPrice;
      }
    }

    if (cart.length > 10) {
      const discount = totalPrice * discountRate;
      const additionalDiscount = discount * 0.2;
      totalPrice -= additionalDiscount;
    } else {
      totalPrice -= totalPrice * discountRate;
    }

    for (const item of cart) {
      if (item.category === "electronics") {
        const additionalTax = item.price * taxRate * 0.1;
        totalPrice += additionalTax;
      } else {
        totalPrice += item.price * taxRate;
      }
    }

    return totalPrice;
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => calculateTotalPrice(20, 20, 20)}>
      Calculate tax
    </button>
  );
};
```

Now, let's break the `calculateTotalPrice` function into smaller parts.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const PriceCalculator = () => {
  const calculateItemPrice = (price, quantity) => {
    let itemPrice = price * quantity;

    if (itemPrice > 100) {
      itemPrice -= itemPrice * 0.1;
    }

    return itemPrice;
  };

  const calculateSubTotal = (cart) => {
    let subTotal = 0;
    for (const item of cart) {
      const itemPrice = calculateItemPrice(item.price, item.quantity);
      subTotal += itemPrice;
    }
    return subTotal;
  };

  const applyTaxes = (amount, taxRate, cart) => {
    let taxedPrice = amount;

    for (const item of cart) {
      if (item.category === "electronics") {
        const additionalTax = item.price * taxRate * 0.1;
        taxedPrice += additionalTax;
      } else {
        taxedPrice += item.price * taxRate;
      }
    }

    return taxedPrice;
  };

  const applyDiscount = (amount, discountRate, cart) => {
    let discountedPrice = amount;

    if (cart.length > 10) {
      const discount = amount * discountRate;
      const additionalDiscount = discount * 0.2;
      discountedPrice -= additionalDiscount;
    } else {
      discountedPrice -= amount * discountRate;
    }

    return discountedPrice;
  };

  const calculateTotalPrice = (cart, discountRate, taxRate) => {
    const subTotal = calculateSubTotal(cart);
    const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(subTotal, discountRate, cart);
    const totalPrice = applyTaxes(discountedPrice, taxRate, cart);

    return totalPrice;
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => calculateTotalPrice(20, 20, 20)}>
      Calculate tax
    </button>
  );
};
```

- This makes code more readable. You can identify with one look at what `calculateTotalPrice` is doing without having to go through the code.
- There is a separation of concerns (if you want to make changes in taxes, you just have to look at `applyTaxes` function and have a smaller scope of code to focus on at once).
- Code is more reusable (if you need `applyTaxes` somewhere else within the file, you can use it directly).

**But why PURE functions?**

- One benefit that can be directly seen is since we have broken down a function and it is just dependent on its parameters, we can easily move it out of the file and into a separate utils file say `price.utils.ts`,
  this makes your main file/component much smaller and easier to traverse.

  Also, Once more functions are moved outside components and to separate files they can be used by other parts of the code as well, preventing duplication.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { applyDiscount, applyTaxes, calculateSubTotal } from "./price.utils.ts";

const PriceCalculator = () => {
  const calculateTotalPrice = (cart, discountRate, taxRate) => {
    const subTotal = calculateSubTotal(cart);
    const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(subTotal, discountRate, cart);
    const totalPrice = applyTaxes(discountedPrice, taxRate, cart);

    return totalPrice;
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => calculateTotalPrice(20, 20, 20)}>
      Calculate tax
    </button>
  );
};
```

- Another benefit is pure functions always produce the same output given the same input regardless of any external factors, this makes your code highly predictable.

## No string literals (use enums or constants)

Using string literals directly (as values) can cause several problems during the maintenance and refactoring of your application.
For example, Say you have the following code.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const getPositionLabel = (position: string) => {
  if (position === "left") {
    return "left" + "index is important";
  }
  if (position === "center") {
    return "center" + "index is important";
  }
  if (position === "right") {
    return "right" + "index is important";
  }
  return "default index is important";
};

// spelling mistakes or even casing mistakes can cause issues
getPositionLabel("centre");
```

In the above code following issues can be easily seen

- **Readability** — The code becomes less readable due to the usage of repeated string literals in the conditional statement, it’s difficult to differentiate values from cosmetic (display) texts like “index is important”.
- **Maintainability & Refactoring** — Since the strings are plain and scattered throughout the code, it’s easy to make mistakes in spelling or casing, leading to bugs that may be hard to spot. For instance, using centre instead of center could result in incorrect behavior.
- **Consistency across the project** — If the same string is used in multiple files within the project, keeping them consistent becomes challenging. In a collaborative environment, different developers might unintentionally use slightly different variations of the same string, leading to inconsistency and potential bugs.

To prevent these issues, we can use enums (or objects) —

<Image
  src="/images/blogs/scalable-react/use-enum.webp"
  width="1080"
  height="400"
  fit="true"
  quality={100}
  alt="use enums"
  className="rounded-md"
/>

- Not only do enums increase readability, but they also increase type safety if used with TS. Now, if a wrong value is provided where a Position is expected, TS will throw an error.
- Also if you now want to change the value of center to centre you can easily change just the value or the enum key itself (which will throw a compilation error everywhere Position.CENTER is used). This makes code easier to maintain and refactor.

## Less logic in render (use more constants)

* By reducing the complex calculations and conditionals within the render, your code becomes much more readable, easier to debug, and less prone to introducing bugs.
* The constants also provide a quick and easy-to-understand meaning to condition/s.

For example, Below is a code snippet with logic inside render, which makes it harder to read and update -

```tsx showLineNumbers
const UserCard = ({ user, profilePic }) => {
  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      {user.age >= 18 ? <p>adult</p> : <p>child</p>}
      {user.subscriptionType === 'premium' ? (
        <p>premium subscription</p>
      ) : (
        <p>standard subscription</p>
      )}
      {user.age >= 18 && user?.showProfile && profilePic ? (
        <img src={profilePic} alt="profile-pic" />
      ) : (
        'No profile'
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Moving the logic outside render and into constants makes the component much simpler-

```tsx showLineNumbers
const UserCard = ({ user, profilePic }) => {
  const isAdult = user.age >= 18;
  const isPremiumUser = user.subscriptionType === 'premium';
  const hasProfilePic = isAdult && user?.showProfile && profilePic;

  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      {isAdult ? <p>adult</p> : <p>child</p>}
      {isPremiumUser ? <p>premium subscription</p> : <p>standard subscription</p>}
      {hasProfilePic ? <img src={profilePic} alt="profile-pic" /> : 'No profile'}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## No nested ternaries (+ early returns)

* Avoiding nested ternaries is another important aspect of writing maintainable and readable React code.
* Nested ternaries can quickly become difficult to follow and understand, leading to code that is harder to maintain and prone to errors.
* Instead, you can use other techniques like conditional rendering with `if-else` or utilizing separate functions for more complex conditions.
For example, A complex nested ternary -


```tsx showLineNumbers
return isLoading
  ? "loading"
  : error
  ? "some error occurred"
  : isAuthenticated
  ? isSuperUser
    ? "show dashboard"
    : isNewUser
    ? "show home page"
    : "show last visited page"
  : "redirect user to login page"
```


Now, let's replace the ternaries with if-else conditional blocks, it becomes comparatively easier to read and understand -

```tsx showLineNumbers

let result : string;

if(isLoading) {
  result = "loading";
} else if (error) {
  result = "some error occurred";
} else if (isAuthenticated) {
  if (isSuperUser) {
    result = "show dashboard";
  } else if (isNewUser) {
    result = "show home page";
  } else {
    result = "show last visited page";
  }
} else {
  result = "redirect user to login page";
}

return result;

```

Although this is more readable than nested ternaries, we can improve this further by implementing an early return pattern -

```tsx showLineNumbers
if (isLoading) {
  return "loading";
}

if (error) {
  return "some error occurred";
}

if (isAuthenticated) {
  if (isSuperUser) {
    return "show dashboard";
  }

  if (isNewUser) {
    return "show home page";
  }

  return "show last visited page";
}

return "redirect user to login page";
```

## Don't reinvent the wheel but also don't add unnecessary packages

* **Leverage existing libraries** - When developing a project, it's wise to capitalize on existing solutions for functionalities that have already been well-addressed by reliable libraries. 
For example, consider a portfolio site with multiple pages. In such a scenario, using an established routing solution like "react-router" would make more sense than building something of your own*

* **Avoiding unnecessary packages** - On the flip side, the urge to hastily adopt libraries for tasks that can be accomplished with simpler, lightweight approaches must be resisted. 
For example, Say again in the portfolio site you have a single "contact me" form, reaching out to libraries like "formik" and "yup" right from the start might not be a good idea.

* **Incrementally adopt while considering performance and UX** - You can always add these libraries later in case your requirements evolve but avoid early addition for marginal benefits it might provide compared to the additional complexity and bundle size that it brings with it. 
For example, say your portfolio has simple fade-in fade-out transitions, consider using lightweight solutions like CSS transitions rather than reaching out for `framer-motion` (**40Kb Gzipped**) directly for such subtle animations.


## Non-logical code organization

When writing code, organizing not only the logical aspects such as functions and components but also the non-logical components like imports and CSS is crucial for code readability and maintainability. 
Two essential components that require effective organization are imports and styles.

* **Imports organization** - Messy and disorganized imports can make it challenging to navigate through files and functions. 
Unorganized imports can also lead to merge conflicts, a part of code that isn't logical is the last thing that should do that, so to prevent such issues we can organize imports in a consistent and systematic manner. 
For example, one way could be the following

```tsx showLineNumbers
// React import
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// External library imports
import { useNavigation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

// Internal absolute path imports
import { Button } from '@/components';
import { useBoolean } from '@/utils';

// Internal relative imports
import ComponentA from '../../components';
import ComponentB from './ComponentB';

// styles imports
import styles from './page.styles.scss';
```

Adopting this organizational style helps to differentiate between different types of imports and makes it easier to locate specific dependencies when working on the codebase.

> You don't need to manually do this in each file, you can use eslint-plugin-import rule or `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` prettier plugin to do this automatically for you.
>
> https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import
> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports



* **CSS organization** - When it comes to writing clean CSS, one aspect that often goes unnoticed but is incredibly important is the organization of your CSS properties. The proper organization not only enhances code readability but also saves valuable time spent searching for specific properties within a class.

❌ Now the worst approach is to randomly write the properties you think of in order. <br />
❌ Another common approach is to order properties by their name. But this approach doesn't help much too. <br />
For example, Imagine you want to see the layout of a class. You check its display is set to `flex `, then you scroll down to 'f' to find the `flex-direction` property. Next, you have to search for `justify-content `, and by the end, you might have forgotten whether it had `align-items` property as well, so you have to go back to 'a' at the top. That's a lot of time wasted.

✅ One better approach we can follow is to group properties in the following order - <br />
  1. Positioning
  2. Layout
  3. Spacing
  4. Typography
  5. Colors
  6. Others

/>

> You can automate this as well using `stylelint` and `stylelint-order` -

## Use useReducer instead of many useState

If you have multiple co-related `useState` in a single component that you don't want to move to Redux or Context, it's better approach to use `useReducer` instead. 
For example, consider the below code to add and remove items from a cart and simultaneously calculate tax, total, and subTotal -

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Cart = () => {
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);
  const [subtotal, setSubtotal] = useState(0);
  const [tax, setTax] = useState(0);
  const [total, setTotal] = useState(0);

  const handleAddItem = (item) => {
    const updatedCartItems = [...cartItems, item];
    const updatedSubtotal = updatedCartItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
    const updatedTax = updatedSubtotal * 0.1;
    const updatedTotal = updatedSubtotal + updatedTax;

    setCartItems(updatedCartItems);
    setSubtotal(updatedSubtotal);
    setTax(updatedTax);
    setTotal(updatedTotal);
  };

  const handleRemoveItem = (item) => {
    const filteredCartItems = cartItems.filter((cartItem) => cartItem.id !== item.id);
    const updatedSubtotalAfterRemove = filteredCartItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
    const updatedTaxAfterRemove = updatedSubtotalAfterRemove * 0.1;
    const updatedTotalAfterRemove = updatedSubtotalAfterRemove + updatedTaxAfterRemove;

    setCartItems(filteredCartItems);
    setSubtotal(updatedSubtotalAfterRemove);
    setTax(updatedTaxAfterRemove);
    setTotal(updatedTotalAfterRemove);
  };
  ...
}
```



In the above example, the state updates are scattered and harder to track, making the code less maintainable. 
Now let's replace it with useReducer -

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = {
  cartItems: [],
  subtotal: 0,
  tax: 0,
  total: 0,
};

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      const updatedCartItems = [...state.cartItems, action.payload];
      const updatedSubtotal = updatedCartItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
      const updatedTax = updatedSubtotal * 0.1;
      const updatedTotal = updatedSubtotal + updatedTax;
      return {
        ...state,
        cartItems: updatedCartItems,
        subtotal: updatedSubtotal,
        tax: updatedTax,
        total: updatedTotal,
      };
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      const filteredCartItems = state.cartItems.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload.id);
      const updatedSubtotalAfterRemove = filteredCartItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
      const updatedTaxAfterRemove = updatedSubtotalAfterRemove * 0.1;
      const updatedTotalAfterRemove = updatedSubtotalAfterRemove + updatedTaxAfterRemove;
      return {
        ...state,
        cartItems: filteredCartItems,
        subtotal: updatedSubtotalAfterRemove,
        tax: updatedTaxAfterRemove,
        total: updatedTotalAfterRemove,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const Cart = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const handleAddItem = (item) => dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', payload: item });
  const handleRemoveItem = (item) => dispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_ITEM', payload: item });

  ...
};
```

By using useReducer, we have centralized the state updates in a single function, making the code more structured and easier to maintain.
Also, since the state changes only from one place now, it helps maintain clear control over how and when state transitions occur, making it easier to debug and reason about your code.


---

## Avoid passing similar props

* When you have a component that takes in multiple props (usually booleans), that essentially serve as variants of each other, it's better to use a more concise and structured approach for its API.
* Instead of cluttering the component with numerous individual props, consider passing a single prop with specific enumerated values to represent the desired options.


For example, consider a Button component that can be styled in various colors, instead of passing separate boolean props like `isPrimary`, `isSecondary`, `isSuccess`, and `isDanger`, we can use a single prop named `variant` to define the desired button style.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Button = ({ isPrimary, isSecondary, isSuccess, isDanger, isTop, isBottom }) => {
  ...
};

<Button isPrimary isTop />
<Button isSuccess isBottom />
<Button isSecondary isBottom />
```

A better approach using variant-type props -

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Button = ({ variant, position }) => {
  ...
};

<Button variant="primary" position="top" />
<Button variant="success" position="bottom" />
<Button variant="secondary" position="bottom" />
```

By adopting this approach and using more descriptive props like `variant` and `position`, we enhance the component's API and make it more user-friendly.
Additionally, we can further enhance type safety by utilizing TypeScript enums for these props.

## Break code into components (single responsibility)


Split your code into smaller components when developing your React application, each with a single responsibility. If a component exceeds a reasonable line limit, like 300 lines, it's a good indicator to break it into separate components.  <br />
Each React component should only be responsible for one task and should not perform functionality that is not related to its responsibility <br />
This practice enhances readability, maintainability, and code reuse. Each component can focus on specific tasks or UI elements, keeping your codebase organized and easy to understand.


> If you follow one component per file approach (recommended), you can also enforce this using ESLint max-lines rule - https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/max-lines.


---

## Keep the state closest to where it's needed


* Avoid keeping all states in the parent component. Instead, keep states closest to where they are needed (state colocation) and lift them up only when necessary.  <br />
This approach prevents unnecessary re-renders in children and keeps parent components smaller.
* If a state is used at several places, try to extract it into Context or Redux (or other state managers) if possible. Doing so will help efficiently share state and maintain a single source of truth for the data.


> **Note - **Context causes its children to re-render on each state change which does not matter in most cases. However, if you still want to use context and optimise it you can check context selectors - https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-context-selector
**> Read more on colocation here - **https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster

## Use Typescript


Utilize TypeScript in your project to enhance code reliability, maintainability, and catch potential errors during development. Follow these basic guidelines while working with TypeScript -


* **Avoid "any": **Minimize the use of the any type. Instead, specify precise types to ensure type safety and enable better code understanding.
* **Prefer "unknown" over "any": **Whenever possible, use the unknown type over any . unknown provides stricter type checking, and you'll need to perform type checks or assertions to access its values, reducing the risk of unintended type errors.
* **Accurate types for API data: **Communicate with your backend dev to find the accurate types for your API data (+ precisely differentiate optional vs mandatory keys to prevent false positives in the front end).
* **Feature-level types: **Create a feature-level types file and name it `featureName.types.ts` like `userProfile.types.ts`. 
For anything more global put it in a generic folder like `types/api.types.ts`(you don't need to put .types.ts for api since it's already in the types folder, but this is a personal preference to find files more easily while file searching).

## Do not disable ESLint warnings

* Do not disable ESLint warnings, if it's a warning or an error it's most probably an issue (especially exhaustive deps for `useEffect`).
* If you have a solid reason to ignore a warning specify with a comment above the ignore rule. 
For example, If you are loading HTML from your own generated string you can disable the `dangersoulySetInnerHTML` warning.


```tsx showLineNumbers
<div
// Calculating internally, safe HTML returned
// eslint-disable-next-line react/no-danger
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: "<div>Hello world</div>"} />
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
const ErrorWrapper = (props: ComponentProps) => (
  <ErrorBoundary>
   {/** forwarding wrapper */}
   {/** eslint-disable-next-line react/jsx-props-no-spreading */}
   <Component {...props} />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

* Don't use disable for the entire file (unless absolutely needed, provide a reason with a comment too). If you feel like you have to constantly ignore a rule, it might be better to consider removing the rule than ignoring it everywhere.

## Conclusion


In conclusion, following these best practices for scalable and maintainable React applications can lead to a more organized and efficient codebase, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the risk of errors. 
Embrace single responsibility components, enums, useReducer, and compound components to build cleaner and sustainable React apps.

Thank you and Happy coding!
